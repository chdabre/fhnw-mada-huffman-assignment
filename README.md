# Solution for mada Assignment Huffman Code

Solution by Dario Breitenstein

## Outline

- An implementation of the scenarios described in the assignment is in HuffmanCodeTest.
- The Huffman Tree generation algorithm is implemented in HuffmanTree.
- A representation of the nodes in the Huffman Tree is implemented in HuffmanTreeNode.
- HuffmanCode implements the methods needed to encode and decode strings with a generated Huffman Tree,
and to convert the Huffman tree to a lookup table representation. 
- FileUtilities provide simplified File I/O methods with terrible error handling.
